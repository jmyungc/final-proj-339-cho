      <h1> Hey, there! </h1>
      <p>
        Nice to meet you, I'm Jessica. I made this site in hopes of de-mystifying certain aspects of UX design portfolios so that you feel inspired and capable of creating your own. On this site, you'll find some useful information, helpful online resources, and a few inspiration UX portfolios. First, we'll establish some essential components of every UX design portfolio (in my humble opinion).
      </p>
      <h1>Three Key Components of an Excellent UX Portfolio</h1>
      <ol>
        <li>1. Personality</li>
          <p> Recruiters look at dozens of design portfolios a day, and what better way to make yours stand out than to make it unique to you! While there are plenty of templates for any web-hosting program you may decide to use, it pays off to really make your portfolio custom-built to your liking, without getting too complex. </p>
        <li>2. Work</li>
          <p> Obviously something that recruiters are looking for are your selected words. The keyword here is "selected". Design recruiters are busy people, and don't have all day to spend looking at your entire library of projects. They don't want to spend too much time on a portfolio, so it's best to give them your best work in the most concise format. Why hide your greatest and most complex projects amongst minor UI design projects you did? It's also important to choose projects that you can talk at length about. Pick the projects that you contributed the most to, or that are the most interesting and relevant to you. This will help you to demonstrate your passion for design when speaking about the projects. </p>
        <li>3. Thinking Process</li>
          <p> Another important aspect of your design portfolio is your thinking process. For each project, you should have a detailed summary of things such as your involvement, how you go about planning, what led you to make certain design decisions, and what you've learned from the experience. Again, choose your most interesting projects so you'll have plenty to talk about. </p>
      </ol>
