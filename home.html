      <h1> Hey, there! </h1>
      <p>
        Nice to meet you, I'm Jessica. I made this site in hopes of de-mystifying certain aspects of UX design portfolios so that you feel inspired and capable of creating your own. <br> <br>On this site, you'll find some useful information, helpful online resources, and a few inspiration UX portfolios. First, we'll establish some essential components of every UX design portfolio (in my humble opinion).

      <h2>Three Key Components of an Excellent UX Portfolio</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><span class="item-heading"><h3>1. Personality</h3></span><br>
          <span class="item-text">Recruiters look at dozens of design portfolios a day, and what better way to make yours stand out than to make it unique to you! While there are plenty of templates for any web-hosting program you may decide to use, it pays off to really make your portfolio custom-built to your liking, without getting too complex.</span> 
        </li>
      </ol>
      <div class="star-icon"><img class="decorative-icon" src="images/home/icon4.png" alt=""></div>
      <ol>
        <li><span class="item-heading"><h3>2. Work</h3></span><br>
          <span class="item-text">Obviously something that recruiters are looking for are your selected works. The keyword here is "selected". <br><br> Design recruiters are busy people, and don't have time to look every project of everyone that applies. They don't want to spend too much time on a portfolio, so it's best to give them your best work in the most concise format. <br><br> It's also important to choose projects that you can talk at length about. Projects that you find particularly interesting would be a great example. Your interest will help demonstrate your passion for design when speaking about the projects.</span>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <div class="work-icon-grid">
        <img class="work-icon-1" src="images/home/icon1.png" alt="">
        <img class="work-icon-2" src="images/home/icon2.png" alt="">
      </div>
      <ol>
        <li><span class="item-heading"><h3>3. Thinking Process</h3></span><br>
          <span class="item-text">Another important aspect of your design portfolio is your thinking process. <br><br> For each project, you should have a detailed summary of things such as your involvement, planning, decision-making, and what you've learned from the experience. <br><br> Again, choose your most interesting projects so you'll have plenty to talk about.</span> 
        </li>
      </ol>
